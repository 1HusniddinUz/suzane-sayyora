  artistStory: `Sharipova Sayyora has been practicing the traditional Uzbek art of suzani embroidery, national patterns and decorative textiles for more than 40 years. In her work, childhood memories, family values and national traditions come together, so that every motif reflects the taste of homemakers and the spirit of the culture.

Throughout her career she has enriched the interiors of many homes, cultural venues and hotels with suzani pieces and traditionally decorated items. Her works are regularly exhibited at local shows and craft festivals, and have been awarded numerous certificates of honor and diplomas. Each piece is made entirely by hand, with special attention to every stitch, with the aim of bringing warmth, refined ornamentation and a unique character into the owner’s home.`,
